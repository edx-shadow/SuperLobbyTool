<--- Changes from V4.4.3 to V4.4.4 [15/09/18] --->
### Current Lobby ###
* Host now coloured in magenta.
* Changed "Mirror Tracks" option to "Disable Mirror Tracks" for added clarity.

### All Lobbies ###
* Host now coloured in magenta in player list tab.

### Overlay ###
* Addedd option to shorten the names of some things in the lobby info column.

### Miscellaneous ###
* Coloured some other text elements.
* Added tooltips (messages which show when you hover over buttons etc.) to all user interface elements.
  This essentially works as the documentation/user guide to Super Lobby Tool.
* Added some more error logging.
* Some code tweaks.

<--- Changes from V4.4.2 to V4.4.3 [12/09/18] --->
### Current Lobby ###
* Now shows whether the lobby is protected by SLT (V4.4.0 or later)
* Fixed a bug when you regain host control after having previously given it to someone else.
  This fix also has the beneficial side effect of speeding up the creation of new lobbies.

### All Lobbies ###
* SLT protected lobbies (V4.4.0 or later) are highlighted in green.
* Reorganised lobby details window, added host details tab.

### Miscellaneous ###
* Added more statusbar messages for some events.
  These include all events which I added sound effects for, plus a couple other events.
* Further improved debug logging.
* Some code tweaks.

<--- Changes from V4.4.1 to V4.4.2 [11/09/18] --->

### Overlay ###
* Added option to hide the header on each column.
* Added the option to shorten player names to a maximum of 9 characters.
   Shortened names will show with a dot as the last character.

### Miscellaneous ###
* Errors when reading configuration files are now more lenient.
   Most errors now have the option to continue reading the config file.
   The program will load default values whenever necessary.
   This can be helpful with updating old configuration files.
   The program can also create a new config file entirely, if one does not exist.
* Added readme files in the ./sounds and ./logs folders.

<--- Changes from V4.4.0 to V4.4.1 [10/09/18] --->

### Banlist/Whitelist ###
* Maximum player count (banlist and whitelist combined) has increased by 12%.
   This is thanks to a memory optimisation.
   There is no hard limit on the count, this just means you can now have around 250 players
   on the list without experiencing any issues.
* Added a count of the number of blocked connections.
   The banlist and whitelist have seperate counts, depending on which list caused the block.
   The count includes multiple blocks of the same player.
   The count is reset to zero whenever the program is closed.
* New statusbar message for when a player is blocked.

### Miscellaneous ###
* Added option for sound effects on certain events.
   To use them you need to place your own audio files into the "sounds" folder:

   File Name:		Played when you:
   "join.wav"		enter a lobby
   "leave.wav"		leave a lobby
   "enabledashost.wav"	become the host
   "accessdenied.wav"	block a connection to the lobby

* Various other bug fixes and tweaks.

### Overlay ###
* Added detailed debug messages to the log file, including any error messages.
* Added option to shorten names in the character column.
   When enabled, the maximum length of a character name is 9.

<--- Changes from V4.3.1 to V4.4.0 [08/09/18] --->

### All Lobbies ###
* List now shows all lobbies regardless of whether there are issues retrieving information.
   Information that fails to be retrieved will show as "Unknown".
   If any lobbies are still not shown, then this is an issue with Steam.

<--- Changes from V4.1.2 to V4.2.1 [18/08/18] --->

### Banlist ###
* Added option to encrypt when importing/exporting text banlists (more on this later)

### Whitelist ###
* Fixed a bug which sometimes caused players to be kicked when Super Lobby Tool loads.

### Overlay ###
* Rewrote overlay code.
* Columns can be auto sized by entering a width of 0.
* Background is now fitted to the size of each column.
* Added race position column. 
   KNOWN BUG: Displays incorrect position after finishing a race.
* Added empty column, for spacing.
* Players are ordered by score/rating, highest first.
* Character column bugs fixed, chosen random character now shown.
* Now shows splitscreen players.
* Fixed some bugs that caused the game to crash (there may still be some).
* For now all other new features/customisation options are inaccessible 
   (sorry no user interface yet, wait for V5).

### Miscellaneous ###
* Updated EasyHook library
* Rollback of SharpDX library, for stability reasons.

### THERE ARE NOW TWO EDITIONS OF SUPER LOBBY TOOL ###
Full edition - All features available
Public edition - Disables the following:
* Adding banlist entries
* Editing banlist entries
* Importing non-encrypted text banlists
* Banlist in config file is ignored, it is instead loaded from an encrypted text file.

Encrypted banlists have been added to safely allow users of the public edition to add 
new players. This is done in three steps:

1. A user of the full edition generates an encrypted list containing new players.
2. This user sends the encrypted text to users of the public version.
3. The user of the public edition adds new players by importing the encrypted text list.

Notes: 
* Users of the public edition can still generate an encrypted list. This is still safe since
   any players on that list must have been imported from an encrypted list provided by a user 
   of the full edition.

* Inside the program folder you will find "banlist_encrypted.txt" which is updated whenever
   you close Super Lobby Tool (both editions). The public edition of the program saves and
   loads the banlist from this file. Therefore banlists can also be distributed by sending this
   file to others.

<--- Changes from V4.1.0 to V4.1.2 [22/07/18] --->

### All Lobbies ###
* Added lobby link generator.
* Removed lobby ID column for increased lobby privacy.
* Player total now takes into account splitscreen players.

### Whitelist ###
* Added new whitelist tab. 
This is for use in custom lobbies for added privacy.

When enabled it overrides the banlist, only players on the list may enter the lobby. 
The whitelist tab includes all features of the banlist tab.

IMPORTANT: You may not be able to join a custom lobby hosted by another player if this
feature is enabled. To prevent this either disable the whitelist, or add the players in that
custom lobby to your whitelist.

* Added ability to add people from your friends list.

### Overlay ###
* Fixed background colour not updating in user interface.

### Miscellaneous ###
* Enabled ability to select multiple items in lists (excluding the all lobbies tab)

   If you wish to disable logging, delete the logs folder.
   To re-enable logging, create a new "logs" folder.
* Major code refinements and reorganisation. This may have introduced new bugs.
* Updated Steamworks.NET libraries.
* Some user interface tweaks.
* Added some useful message boxes / statusbar messages.
* Prevented opening multiple instances of Super Lobby Tool.

   players in the lobby and gives the option to view Steam profiles.
* The "Join Lobby" and "View Players in Lobby" controls perform several checks, 
   including (but not limited to):
   If the lobby no longer exists
   If the lobby contains a banned player
   If you are already in the lobby

### Banlist ###
* Added enable/disable banlist option (unfortunately this means old configuration files will not work).

<@@@ KNOWN BUGS @@@>
* Sometimes after using the "All Lobbies" tab, the game will fail to create new lobbies. 
   This is Steam behaving strangely, it should clear up after waiting about 30 seconds.

* Sometimes multi-selecting checks/unchecks items for no reason.
   This seems to be a bug in the windows user interface, needs further investigation.

* Lobbies which contain 10 players may not show in the All Lobbies tab.
   This is a feature of the Steam matchmaking system, unfortunately it cannot be disabled.
